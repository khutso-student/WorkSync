## 🎯 Purpose of the Project

Managing employees, projects, and workplace communication can be challenging, especially for growing teams or distributed workforces. **WorkSync** was developed to solve key organizational issues, such as:

- Difficulty tracking active employees
- Lack of transparency in project progress
- Poor internal communication between staff and leadership
- No centralized place for real-time updates and feedback

**WorkSync** simplifies team management and boosts productivity through a unified, smart dashboard experience.
